# Python-Test-Programs

I made another repository for my short python projects beforehand, but it was mostly very simple projects and cluttered with junk files. 

So now I made a new repository as a sort of portfolio for simple, one or two-file python projects assembled in the same place. You're welcome to explore my programs and experiment with them. There are, in a way, practice for my CS classes next year. I mostly use python, but I might use other languages in the future.
